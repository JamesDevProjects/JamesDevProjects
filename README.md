# Hi, I'm James  

I'm a software developer with a focus on **backend development, security, and automation**. I like building things that solve real problems—whether it's improving security, automating repetitive tasks, or making systems more efficient. 


### What I Work On  
- **Backend Development** – Python, Node.js, Flask, Express  
- **Cybersecurity & Web Security** – Ethical hacking, vulnerability detection, SQL Injections  
- **Automation** – Scripting, APIs, system monitoring  

### Some of My Projects  
- **[Web Security Scanner](https://github.com/JamesDevProjects/Web-Security-Scanner)** – A Python tool that scans websites for missing security headers and exposed directories.  
- **[Password Strength Checker](https://github.com/JamesDevProjects/PasswordStrengthChecker)** – A JavaScript-based tool to evaluate password security and detect compromised passwords.
